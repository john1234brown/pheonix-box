# Purpose and Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop and release an npm package designed to be integrated within the Phoenix Box CLI binary. This npm package will serve as a tamper-proofing mechanism for the binary executable at runtime. The goal is to ensure the integrity and security of the executable by detecting and preventing unauthorized modifications during execution.

Additionally, this project will provide detailed documentation to guide users on how to implement and utilize the npm module for runtime-level tamper-proofing of their executables. The documentation will cover installation, configuration, and best practices to maximize the security benefits offered by the package.
