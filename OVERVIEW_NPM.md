# Pheonix Box CLI Overview
The Pheonix Box NPM Module is a TypeScript-based library designed to manage and process files with a focus on security. It offers encryption and hashing capabilities to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of files. The project is compiled and bundled with Webpack for distribution.

## Key Features

1. **File Management and Processing**
    - Specify directories and file types for processing.
    - Recursively scan directories, generate file lists, and perform operations on the files.

2. **Encryption**
    - **Caesar Cipher**: A simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.
    - **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A more secure encryption method using a 256-bit key, suitable for protecting sensitive data.

3. **Hashing**
    - Generate hashes for files to verify their integrity and ensure they have not been tampered with.

4. **Configuration Management**
    - Uses a JSON configuration file (`configurable.json`) to manage settings such as paths, file types, encryption keys, and debug options.
    - The `Config` class provides methods to modify and save these settings.

5. **Concurrency**
    - Utilize multiple CPU threads to process files in parallel, improving performance.
    - Uses Node.js's cluster module to fork worker processes.

6. **State Management**
    - Save and load the application's state, including encryption keys and file hashes, ensuring continuity between sessions.

7. **Debugging**
    - A debug mode that logs detailed information about operations, useful for troubleshooting.

## Detailed Explanation

### Initialization and Configuration
- Initializes the `JohnsPheonixBox` class, which handles the main functionality.
- Loads configuration from `configurable.json` or a specified asset location.
- Loads the previous state if the state file exists, including encryption keys and file hashes.

### File Processing
- The `getFileList` method generates a list of files to be processed based on the configured paths.
- Can filter files by type or regular expression.

### Encryption and Decryption
- The `JohnsWorker` class handles encryption and decryption.
- Uses Caesar Cipher for basic encryption and AES for more secure encryption.
- The `encrypt` method first applies the Caesar Cipher and then, if enabled, applies AES encryption.

### Concurrency
- The `startProcess` method in `JohnsPheonixBox` uses the cluster module to fork worker processes.
- Each worker processes a chunk of the file list, improving performance for large file sets.

### State Management
- The `saveState` and `loadState` methods handle saving and loading the application's state, ensuring seamless resumption after a restart.

### Debugging
- The `log` method in `JohnsPheonixBox` and `JohnsWorker` classes logs messages to the console if debug mode is enabled, aiding in monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Security Usages

1. **File Integrity**
    - Detect changes or tampering by generating and storing hashes for files.

2. **Confidentiality**
    - Encrypt files using AES to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

3. **Tamper Detection**
    - Use hashing and encryption to detect and prevent unauthorized changes to files.

4. **Secure Configuration**
    - Customize the application's behavior securely through the configuration file, managing encryption keys and other settings.

5. **Concurrency and Performance**
    - Process files efficiently using multiple CPU threads, suitable for large-scale file management tasks.

6. **State Persistence**
    - Preserve encryption keys and other critical data across sessions by saving and loading the application's state.

## Conclusion

The Pheonix Box NPM Module is a powerful tool for managing and securing files. Its encryption and hashing capabilities ensure the confidentiality and integrity of files, making it suitable for various security applications. The configurable settings, concurrency support, and state management features make it a versatile and efficient solution for file processing tasks.
